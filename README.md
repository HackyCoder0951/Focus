## Introduction

We created this full-stack community-based networking web app (FOCUS). It serves as a link between current undergraduate students and their former classmates. Our app has three sections: studentshub, job resources & qa, and higher education & resources. Studentshub is a place where current students can post, like, and comment on other student's posts. Both current students and graduates can benefit from the job resources and Q&A. Alumni can post job openings here, and current students can ask questions about topics they don't understand and share their issues with alumni.
All of the questions asked by current students can be answered by alumni. Higher studies and resources make up the final section of our software. Here, alumni or students can submit files that will be useful to other students. Scholarships news can be posted by alumni or students. Alumni who are studying at different institutions have their profiles depending on which university they attend.
Another important element of our app is messaging. Students and alumni can begin conversing in real-time. Real-time notification support is also available in our app.
